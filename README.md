# Project-359
Biomass Based Thermal Energy Generation By Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Limited, at FTO-11, Devunipalavalasa, Srikakulam, AP

The project Biomass Based Thermal Energy Generation is in Village Devunipalavalasa, Tehsil
Ranasthalam, District Srikakulam, State Andhra Pradesh, Country INDIA.

Purpose of the project activity:
Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (DRL), a leading multinational pharmaceutical company based in India
and overseas, committed to providing affordable and innovative medicines.
Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories started in 1984 with a modest investment and a bold vision. Today, with
research and development centres, manufacturing facilities and commercial presence across the
globe, we serve over half a billion patients worldwide. Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories aspire to triple our
reach and touch over 1.5 billion patients by 2030

The UCR project activity consists of the generation of thermal energy by utilizing renewable
biomass process boilers of total installed capacity of 05 TPH at the Formulation Tech-Ops-11
(FTO-11), owned and operated by the Project Proponent (PP). The project activity involves the
installation of one (01) Biomass Briquette fired steam boilers with a steam output capacity of 05
TPH (at F & A 1000C). This project activity uses renewable biomass briquettes as fuel and supplies
the process steam throughout the plant for an important process of manufacturing. sterilization and
clean steam generation for advanced procedures within the project boundary at FTO-11,
Devunipavalas, Srikakulam.

The boiler installed is “Stepped grate” types that ensure 100% firing of biomass briquettes/rice
husk, through intelligent combustion manager.

Conventionally, steam required for the processes in FTO-11 was met through a coal fired co-gen
plant which is operating in an adjacent plant. Fossil fuel combustion produces greenhouse gases
(GHGs). This project activity displaces/avoids the use of fossil fuel (coal) with briquette (renewable
biomass) which is a clean and carbon neutral energy source. Thus, the project activity helps in
reduction of GHG emissions. Also, there was a loss of around 50% thermal energy in the steam
supply lines from the co-gen power plant to the PP’s process units.

The primary technology for the project activity involves installation of 1*5 TPH biomass fired
boilers. The direct combustion of biomass in the boiler is converted into thermal energy, which is
utilized for steam generation. The boiler (5 TPH) in the project activity was commissioned on
15.09.2022.

The briquettes, used in the boiler within the project activity, are composed of mainly agro-based
industrial residues and crop residues, based on their availability from the surrounding region outside
the project boundary (the PP is not the producer of the processed solid biomass fuel as specified in
the requirements of the UCR CoU Standard for inclusion in the updated eligibility conditions
specified in the UCR biomass program).

The Stepped grate offers progressive combustion with distinct combustion zones making it the ideal
solution for biomass briquette combustion with higher moisture. This grate offers the fuel flexibility
and can burn complex agricultural biomass fuels like forest wastes, empty fruit bunches, spice
waste, soya stock, and many other biomasses.

In the pre-project scenario, the process
steam demand of the plant was met by a coal fired boiler (co-gen power plant from an adjacent
facility). The project results in reductions of CO2 emissions that are real, measurable and give longterm benefits to the mitigation of climate change.
